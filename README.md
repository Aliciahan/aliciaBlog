## Resume

What is the difference between a blog and a Markdown Reader as the component in GitHub? Maybe that is we can personalise our theme and have a fully control of the blog, maybe, we can give the possibility for the others to leave comments. 

The Hexo architecture is a good practice of combining two things as one. 

But the practice of using the hosting service of GitHub is **SOOOOOOO ANNOYING**. especially when we want to use a theme hexo, there's always this message appear:

*The page build completed successfully, but returned the following warning:*

*You are attempting to use a Jekyll theme, "hexo-theme-primer", which is not supported by GitHub Pages. Please visit https://pages.github.com/themes/ for a list of supported themes. If you are using the "theme" configuration variable for something other than a Jekyll theme, we recommend you rename this variable throughout your site.

This already makes me lost my interests, after 2 hrs of choosing the RIGHT theme. 

(╥﹏╥) **Forget about it!** just WRITE static pages.... IT IS FASTER.....(☍﹏⁰。)
